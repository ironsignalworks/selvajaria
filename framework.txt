Extra polish moves (worth doing)

Set GitHub Pages to the custom domain and keep the github.io URL as a fallback

Add a canonical link and OG image on the custom domain (sharing looks pro)

Set up redirects so old links never break

Add these “pro” upgrades (cheap for you, valuable for them)

Content model in CMS (Releases, Artists, Products)

Preview workflow (even simple staging env)

SEO basics (title/description per release, OG tags)

Performance budget + basic monitoring (Lighthouse baseline)

Deployment pipeline with previews (Netlify/Vercel previews even for static builds)

Analytics events (release clicks, store clicks)
